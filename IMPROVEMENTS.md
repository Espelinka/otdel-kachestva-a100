## ✅ ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Code Duplication (FIXED ✓)
- **Before**: CSS and JS were duplicated in both inline and external files
- **After**: All styles moved to `css/style.css`, all scripts to `js/script.js`
- **Impact**: Reduced file size, easier maintenance, better caching

### 2. External File References (FIXED ✓)
- **Before**: External CSS and JS files were not linked
- **After**: Properly linked with `<link>` and `<script>` tags
- **Impact**: Proper separation of concerns, modular code structure

### 3. Footer Always at Bottom (FIXED ✓)
- **Before**: Footer position varied depending on content
- **After**: Implemented flexbox layout with sticky footer
- **Implementation**: 
  - `body` uses `display: flex; flex-direction: column`
  - `#content-wrapper` has `flex: 1`
  - `footer` has `margin-top: auto`
- **Impact**: Footer always stays at bottom regardless of page content

### 4. PDF Opening Behavior (FIXED ✓)
- **Before**: Browser prompted to download or open
- **After**: PDFs open directly in new tab viewer
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created iframe to force browser PDF viewer
  - Opens in `_blank` target
  - Added loading overlay during PDF opening
  - Fallback for popup blockers
- **Impact**: Better user experience, PDFs open immediately
